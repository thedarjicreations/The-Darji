# Logo Instructions

## How to Add Your Brand Logo to Invoices

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
1. **Format**: PNG file (transparent background recommended)
2. **Size**: Recommended 100x100 pixels to 200x200 pixels
3. **File Name**: `logo.png`

### Step 2: Place the Logo File
Save your logo file here:
```
d:\The Darji\TECH\server\assets\logo.png
```

### Current Location
This file is located at:
```
d:\The Darji\TECH\server\assets\README.md
```

Just place your `logo.png` file in the same folder!

### What Happens?
- ✅ Logo automatically appears on the left of "THE DARJI" brand name
- ✅ Size: 40px height (width adjusts automatically)
- ✅ If logo file is missing, invoice works fine without it
- ✅ If logo fails to load, invoice continues normally

### Testing
After placing your logo:
1. Generate any invoice
2. Check the header - your logo should appear!
3. If it doesn't show, check:
   - File is named exactly `logo.png`
   - File is in the correct folder
   - File format is PNG

### Tips
- Square or slightly rectangular logos work best
- Transparent background looks most professional
- Keep file size under 500KB for fast loading
